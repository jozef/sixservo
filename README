NAME

    sixservo.ino - control 6 servo motors via serial console

SYNOPSIS

    after flashing into Arduino, connect via serial console 9600 to send
    commands:

        supported commands:
            sd [X] [int]             - turn servo to 0-180
            ss [X] [int]             - set puls width 500-2500
            sr [X] [int]             - set position relative to zero -1000-1000
            sweep [X] [int] [int]    - sweep servo [X] 0-180-0, optional step delay and count
            d [X]                    - detach / stop controlling the servo
            p [X]                    - print position
            z [X]                    - set current as zero position
            c [X]                    - calibrate
            m [X] [int] [int]        - monitor servos
            dump [X]                 - show servo debug values
            ?                        - print this help
        [X] is servo index 1-6 or bitwise 0100-0177 (6 last bits as mask), default is zero -> 0177
        ss 1 1500
        ok 1
        sd 0143 45
        ok 1
        ok 2
        ok 6

DESCRIPTION

    Serial console accepts commands and sets servo motor accordingly.

COMMANDS

    [X] is servo index 1-6 or bitwise 0100-0177 (6 last bits as mask),
    default is zero -> 0177

 sd [X] [int] [int]

    Set servo angle. Value range 0 to 180.

 ss [X] [int] [int]

    Set servo angle using PWM peak time length in nano seconds. Value range
    500 to 2500.

sweep [X] [int] [int]

    Moves servo with index of first parameter from 90 to 180, then back to
    0 and again to 90 degree.

    Both parameters are optional. First sets the time in milliseconds to
    wait between each angle change, default 15. The second is the number of
    repeats, default 1.

dump [X]

    Will dump servo data.

d [X]

    Will detach - stop sending PWM to servo, turning the control off.

TODO

    In the future, if time and motivation persists, the code may evolve
    into full multi-servo test/control module.
